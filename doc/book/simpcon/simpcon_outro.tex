\section{Summary}

This chapter describes a simple (with respect to the definition and
implementation) and efficient SoC interconnect \cite{simpcon}. The
novel signal \sign{rdy\_cnt} allows an early signalling to the master
when read data will be valid. This feature allows the master to
restart a stalled pipeline earlier to react for arriving data.
Furthermore, this feature also enables pipelined bus transactions
with a minimal effort on the master and the slave side.

We have compared SimpCon quantitative with AMBA and Avalon, two
common interconnection definitions. The application benchmark shows a
performance advantage of SimpCon by 17\% over AMBA and 19\% over
Avalon interfaces to an SRAM.

SimpCon is used as the main interconnect for the Java processor JOP
in a single master, multiple salves configuration. SimpCon is also
used to implement a shared memory chip-multiprocessor version of JOP.
Furthermore, in a research project on time-triggered network-on-chip
\cite{jop:ttnoc} SimpCon is used as the \emph{socket} to this NoC.

The author thanks Kevin Jennings and Tommy Thorn for the interesting
discussions about SimpCon, Avalon, and on-chip interconnection in
general at the Usenet newsgroup \texttt{comp.arch.fpga}.
