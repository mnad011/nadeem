TODOs
------

o) MethodCacheAnalysis
- findRemovedMethods(): Current implementation not correct, needs fixing
- make cache cost estimation for ALL_FIT_REGIONS approximation more precise when region changes
- handle case when region increases

o) EjipCmp benchmark does not work
- We need to remove Tcp.run() from callee set of Runnable.run(), else it will try to invoke
  TcpHandler.*, which has no implementations since the benchmark does not use Tcp implementation classes

o) Strange behaviour with dfa-cache
- Debie-benchmark WCA usually throws nullpointer if analyzed the first time after optimization, works
  when cache is used and analyzed a second time

o) Strange results in target/wcet/
- For some reason there are wcet-result versions with '.' instead of '_' in package name like
  target/wcet/wcet.StartBenchUdpIP_measure
  which have uncorrect results (no loop bounds). Possibly generated during optimization, should be disabled.
